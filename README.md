## General Info
***
The logistics company Creepy Events, precursor of great events such as the purge, the labyrinth, the hunger games, battle royale, the squid game, among others; wants to develop a web app for a new Coders culling event in a fair way. It will be a system that randomly selects a name from a list. Once a name appears on the wheel, it cannot appear again until the wheel of doom is reset. It has to be able to work on any device.
